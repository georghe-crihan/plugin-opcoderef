Instruction set reference plug-in for IDA.

It was created, mainly for the reason that my knowledge of the MMX instruction
set is not too deep. So, not to loose time, while poking into reference books, 
inspired by the description in the www.wasm.ru/tools/disassemblers/Hackman, I
created this masterpiece ;-) Besides, I had two goals in mind:
   - Demonstrate that a plug-in for IDA could be written even in assembly
   - Throw away Hackman to free up extra 25 Mb on my hard drive(I am talking of
 my distribution of 5.01, with not only disassembler included) ;-)

Note, that IDA has a 'Third-party help file feature' (see HELPFILE= in
idagui.cfg) which could show you help on current instruction, but since it is
rather awkward, I don't like it, really.

Features:
 - Can be built with TASM, MASM, NASM
 - The help could be converted to many formats (html, TeX, rtf, see get_doc.pl)
 - The help can be generated for any supported CPU and will work as plugin
 - The help source could be generated from any Hackman-like formated source
 - The help source could be generated from any formated source via an alternate
parser plugin (see get_doc.pl).
 - There could be alternate mnemonics for the instructions (see hackman.conf)
 - The help file could be updated at runtime without plug-in unload
 - Integration into the IDA interface (via standard help or as a pop-up window)
 - The plug-in is help-independent (topic IDs are just CRC32 hashes)
 - The plug-in is fast and small sized (assembly version is 4Kb compiled DLL,
most of which are stub and alignment)
 - The plug-in is nearly SDK-independent (just update the import library and
the IDP_INTERFACE_VERSION constant), since most of the API, in particular the
constants (PLUGIN), message numbers (callui), the function arguments (callui,
ua_mnem, idadir), structures (processor_t, plugin_t) are ulikely change, well,
anyway ;-)

Bugs:
 - Windows-only. There is no such a help system in OS/2 (afaik, anyway) and dos.

Tested on:
 - NT workstation/SP6 + IDA 4.3

TODO:
 - Add nicely formatted rtf support for printed documentation
 - Maybe add texinfo output support

Possible use
  One can, for example:
  1. convert the Alpha Architecture Handbook from PDF to text
  2. write a parser module for it in Perl
  3. plug it in, preprocess the input source using get_doc.pl
  4. process the output with windows help compiler
  5. name it opcoderef24.hlp (processor_t.id = PLFM_ALPHA for the DEC Alpha
 architecture)
  6. place it in the plugins directory
  7. have a handy instruction set reference right in IDA!

Versions of hackman supported by the input parser:
  5.01, 8.01, hope all versions in between are OK.
  I prefer 5.01 since it doesn't have a score of duplicate sections, so
the stuff included is for 5.01.
